				<h2>Hello and welcome to “preprocessadvisor.com” </h2>
				<p> In this website we are giving you advise about  the optimal steps you can take while making a Data Science related project.</p> 
				<p><img src="images/Resim1.png" alt="" width="40%"  class="alignleft" /> <h3>First of all what is Data Preprocessing?</h3> <br>
					<p>A simple definition could be that data preprocessing is a data mining technique to turn the raw data gathered from diverse sources into cleaner information that’s more suitable for work. In other words, it’s a preliminary step that takes all of the available information to organize it, sort it, and merge it. 
					 <br><br> Let’s explain that a little further. Data science techniques try to extract information from chunks of data. That vast amount of information is heterogenous by nature, which means that they don’t share the same structure – that’s if they have a structure to begin with.
					 </p>

					Raw data can have missing or inconsistent values as well as present a lot of redundant information. The most common problems you can find with raw data can be divided into 3 groups:
					<br><br><b> Missing data:</b> Missing data often appears when there’s a problem in the collection phase, such as a glitch that caused a system’s downtime, mistakes in data entry, or issues with biometrics use, among others.
					<br> <br><b>Noisy data:</b> this group encompasses erroneous data and outliers that you can find in the data set but that is just meaningless information. Here you can see noise made of human mistakes, rare exceptions, mislabels, and other issues during data gathering.
				<br><br><b>Inconsistent data:</b> inconsistencies happen when you keep files with similar data in different formats and files. Duplicates in different formats, mistakes in codes of names, or the absence of data constraints often lead to inconsistent data, that introduces deviations that you must deal with before analysis. </p>
				<br> <p>By now, you’ve surely realized why your data preprocessing is so important. Since mistakes, redundancies, missing values, and inconsistencies all compromise the integrity of the set, you need to fix all those issues for a more accurate outcome. Thus, before using that data for the purpose you want, you need it to be as organized and “clean” as possible.	</p>
